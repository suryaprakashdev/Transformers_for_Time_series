# GeoX



## Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Data files

The datasets of well logs and the marker depths have been extracted from the state government websites of USA. The datset for each well is extrated seperately and then joined together to create the whole dataset.
    
A sample dataset is provided, just to understant the format of the final created dataset.

- [ ] [Colorado dataset](https://ecmc.state.co.us/data.html#/cogis) 
- [ ] [Wyoming dataset](https://pipeline.wyo.gov/wellchoiceMenu2.cfm?oops=ID88107&Skip=Y) 
- [ ] [UEA](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/) is a benchmark dataset for multivariate time series classification. It can be downloaded from the website or using the tsai library.

## Test and Deploy

We have tutorial notebooks on the deployment of the functions for different use cases.

## Installation

To install all the packages needed for to run the file. Please execute the Install.py file.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
